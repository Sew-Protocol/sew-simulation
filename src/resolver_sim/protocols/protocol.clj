(ns resolver-sim.protocols.protocol
  "DisputeProtocol — the interface that protocol plugins must implement.

   The replay engine calls these methods during scenario execution.
   Implementations must be pure (no I/O, no DB) and deterministic.

   Usage:
     Implement DisputeProtocol via deftype or defrecord, then pass an instance
     to replay/replay-with-protocol alongside a scenario map. The SEW
     implementation lives in resolver-sim.protocols.sew.

   Layering: this namespace has no dependencies on contract_model/*, model/*,
   sim/*, db/*, or io/*. It serves as the harness interface.")

(defprotocol DisputeProtocol
  "Plugin interface for dispute-resolution protocol implementations.

   This interface provides a harness structure for replay-driven simulation. 
   It is currently instantiated for the SEW Protocol but is designed as a 
   template for future integration of other protocols."

    "Build an execution context from agent list and protocol parameters.
     agents          — [{:id str :address str :role str :strategy str ...}]
     protocol-params — map of protocol-specific config (same shape as
                       :protocol-params in a scenario map)
     Returns a context map passed opaquely to every dispatch-action call.
     Must include :agent-index {agent-id → agent} for replay metrics.")

  (check-invariants-single [protocol world]
    "Single-world invariant checks (e.g. solvency, non-negative balances).

     Should exclude large internal state and keep only relevant metrics.")

  (init-world [protocol scenario]
    "Return an initial world-state map from the scenario.
     scenario — the full scenario map; the protocol may read :initial-block-time,
                :token-params, :events, and any other fields it needs.
     Returns a world map ready to be passed to dispatch-action.")

  (compute-projection [protocol world]
    "Return [projection projection-hash] for trace output.
     projection      — a lean map of fields comparable against EVM state, or nil.

       :transition/type  — semantic action category (see trace-metadata/transition-types)
       :resolution/path  — resolution route, or :resolution/none
     Note: :effect/type is intentionally absent — accounting effects depend on
     world state at resolution time and cannot be derived from action name alone.
     Return nil for protocols that do not produce transition metadata.")

    "Resolve any ID alias in the event params to its integer ID.

       - If an alias pattern is present but not in id-alias-map → return
         {:ok false :error :unresolved-alias :alias str :seq n}.
       - If no alias is present → return {:ok true :event event} unchanged.

    "Return a seq of entity IDs that are still open/unresolved at end of scenario.
     The replay engine calls this after the event loop when :allow-open-disputes?
