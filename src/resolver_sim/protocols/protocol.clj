(ns resolver-sim.protocols.protocol
  "DisputeProtocol — the interface that protocol plugins must implement.

   The replay engine calls these methods during scenario execution.
   Implementations must be pure (no I/O, no DB) and deterministic.

   Usage:
     Implement DisputeProtocol via deftype or defrecord, then pass an instance
     to replay/replay-with-protocol alongside a scenario map. The SEW
     implementation lives in resolver-sim.protocols.sew.

   Layering: this namespace has no dependencies on contract_model/*, model/*,
   sim/*, db/*, or io/*. It serves as the harness interface.")
