(ns resolver-sim.protocols.sew.state-machine
  "Pure Clojure port of StateManagementLibrary.sol.

   Each function mirrors one Solidity state transition, including the
   caller-site precondition guards that appear in BaseEscrow.sol.

   All functions return {:ok bool :world world' :error keyword}.
   No side effects. World state is immutable; transitions return a new map.

   ## Declarative transition graph

   `allowed-transitions` is the single authoritative source of which
   EscrowState → EscrowState edges are legal.  Every function that changes
   :escrow-state goes through `apply-transition!`, which consults the graph
   and throws a programming-error exception if an illegal edge is attempted.
   The caller-visible result maps use `valid-transition?` in their guards to
   return typed {:ok false :error kw} results before the edge is attempted.

   ## Note on :resolved

   transitionToResolved() is defined in StateManagementLibrary.sol but is
   NEVER called by any BaseEscrow production code path (verified from source).
   Disputes always terminate in :released or :refunded.  :resolved is retained
   in the graph for enum completeness and Foundry/halmos compatibility, and is
   reachable only after terminal-transfer-done? confirms accounting is settled."
