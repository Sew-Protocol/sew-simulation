  "Pure Clojure port of EscrowVault balance and fee accounting, plus
   BondCollector fee deduction logic.

   Covers:
     - total-held-per-token tracking (add on create, sub on release/refund)
     - total-fees-per-token (monotonically increasing; withdraw-fees resets)
     - claimable-balances (pull-settlement entitlements; cleared on withdrawEscrow)
     - withdraw-fees
     - BondCollector appeal bond accounting

   All arithmetic uses integer division (uint256 truncation semantics)."
