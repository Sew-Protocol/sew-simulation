  "SEW-specific terminal trace projection.

   Produces the :terminal-world / :metrics / :trace-summary map expected by
   evaluate-mechanism-properties and evaluate-equilibrium-concepts when the
   SEW DisputeProtocol implementation is in use.

   This is the SEW reference implementation of the trace-projection protocol
   method.  The generic projection utilities (map-delta, nested-sum-by-actor,
   classify-coalition-actor?) live in resolver-sim.scenario.projection and are
   re-used here.

   This namespace is pure — no I/O, no DB, no side effects."

     :metrics                 — accumulated metrics
     :trace-summary           — high-level trace statistics
