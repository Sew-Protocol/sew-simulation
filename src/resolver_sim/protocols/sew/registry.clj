(ns resolver-sim.protocols.sew.registry
  "Resolver registration and staking registry for the SEW protocol.
   Supports Phase K (Tiered Authority) by tracking resolver 'Skin in the Game'.

   Key concepts:
     - Resolver Stake: Amount of capital a resolver has locked in the protocol.
     - Escrow Cap: The maximum escrow amount a resolver is permitted to handle.
     - Slash Capacity: The amount a resolver can be slashed before being disabled.

   Constraints:
     - MAX_SLASH_PER_OFFENSE = 50%
     - RESOLVER_SLASH_CAP_BPS = 20% (per epoch/period)"
