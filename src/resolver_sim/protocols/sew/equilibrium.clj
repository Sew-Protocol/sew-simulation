(ns resolver-sim.protocols.sew.equilibrium
  "SEW-specific mechanism-property and equilibrium-concept validators.

   These validators are registered with evaluate-mechanism-properties and
   evaluate-equilibrium-concepts via SEWProtocol's mechanism-property-validators
   and equilibrium-concept-validators methods.

   SEW-specific validators included here:
     Mechanism properties:
       :individual-rationality       — uses negative-payoff-count / payoff-ledger
       :collusion-resistance         — uses coalition-net-profit / payoff-ledger
       :stake-flow-conservation      — uses resolver-stakes SEW world field
     Equilibrium concepts:
       :subgame-perfect-equilibrium                — delegates to subgame-cf
       :bounded-public-state-epsilon-spe           — delegates to subgame-cf
       :bounded-backward-induction-spe             — delegates to subgame-cf
       :resolver-reputation-spe                    — delegates to subgame-cf
       :resolver-reputation-profile-matrix         — delegates to subgame-cf

   Generic validators (budget-balance, incentive-compatibility, sybil-resistance,
   dominant-strategy-equilibrium, nash-equilibrium, etc.) remain in
   resolver-sim.scenario.equilibrium and are available to all protocols.

   This namespace is pure — no I/O, no DB, no side effects."
