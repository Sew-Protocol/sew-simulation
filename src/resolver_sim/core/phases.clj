(ns resolver-sim.core.phases
  "Phase registry and per-mode runner helpers.

   Each run-* function orchestrates one simulation mode: it calls the relevant
   sim namespace, prints a summary, writes output files, and returns the result
   map.  All I/O (print + file write) lives here; the phase namespaces are pure.

   `phase-runners` is the dispatch table used by -main to route CLI flags to
   the correct runner.  To add a new phase:
     1. Add a require above.
     2. Add an entry to phase-runners.
     3. Add a cli-option entry in core.cli."
