(ns resolver-sim.io.trace-score
  "Scoring function for replay traces.

   Assigns a numeric :trace-score to any replay-scenario result.  Higher
   scores indicate traces that are more valuable for regression coverage:

     score = attacker-profit
           + (* 10 invariant-violations)
           + (* 5  liveness-failure?)

   Definitions
   -----------
   attacker-profit
     Number of attack-successes recorded in :metrics.  This is a proxy for
     economic damage: each successfully executed attacker action (create,
     dispute, resolution) that succeeded represents a potential gain.
     If the scenario includes explicit agent-type annotations (attacker),
     `:metrics :attack-successes` is the count.  We scale it by 1 here;
     callers may substitute a richer profit figure from the world state.

   invariant-violations
     Count of invariant violations recorded in :metrics.  Weighted ×10
     because a violated invariant is a protocol-level failure.

   liveness-failure?
     1 if any escrow in the final state is still :pending or :disputed at
     the last trace step (escrow never resolved).  Weighted ×5.

   Categories
   ----------
   score-category classifies a scored result into one or more category
   keywords for selective persistence:
     :top-profitable  — attack-successes > 0
     :liveness-fail   — liveness-failure? = true
     :cascade         — disputes-triggered > 1
     :abnormal-slash  — invariant-violations > 0 AND slashing-related violation"
