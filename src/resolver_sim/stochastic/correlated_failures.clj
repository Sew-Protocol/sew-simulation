   Single-resolver assumption: Each resolver decides independently.
   Reality: Resolvers share...
   - Geographic location → timezone biases
   - Language/culture → narrative interpretation
   - Training/priors → shared blindspots
   - News/social media → correlated information
   - Incentive structures → convergent behavior

   diversity, but collapses at certain correlation thresholds."
