;; Dispute resolution for a single trial
;; Phase D: Track slashing reasons (timeout/reversal/fraud) without RNG changes
(defn resolve-dispute
  "Resolve one dispute with given parameters and strategy.

   Phase D adds slashing reason tracking (timeout/reversal/fraud).
   Reasons are deterministically derived from existing state.
   Phase G adds slashing delays and control baseline support.
   Phase H adds realistic bond mechanics: immediate freeze, unstaking delays, appeal windows.
   MC-1 adds fraud-success-rate: escrow-diversion upside for malicious resolvers.
   MC-4 adds model-appeal-costs?: appeal-bond recovery for honest resolvers when appeal fails.

   Detection mechanisms (mutually exclusive priority order):
     1. fraud-detected?    — intentional wrong verdict caught (fraud-slash-bps penalty)
     2. reversal-detected? — L1 verdict overturned by L2 (reversal-slash-bps penalty)
     3. l2-slashed?        — Kleros backstop catches wrong verdict (fraud-slash-bps penalty)
     4. timeout-detected?  — resolver missed deadline (timeout-slash-bps penalty)
     5. l1-slashed?        — generic L1 detection (slash-mult penalty, reason :timeout)

   Returns:
   {:dispute-correct? bool        ; Whether resolver judged correctly
    :appeal-triggered? bool       ; Whether initial appeal happened
    :escalated? bool              ; Whether case went beyond L0 (level > 0)
