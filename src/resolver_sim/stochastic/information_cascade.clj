   Models: When later reviewers see prior decisions, they may:
   - Follow correct prior decisions (good)
   - Follow incorrect prior decisions (bad)
   - Escalate when uncertain (correct behavior)

  "Probability that a later resolver follows a prior decision.
   
   Theory: In information cascades (Banerjee 1992, Welch 1992):
   - If many people believe something, individuals follow despite private signals
   - Reputational pressure makes dissent costly
   - System can lock into wrong outcome
   
   Parameters:
   - prior-alignment: Does prior outcome match your view? [0.0 - 1.0]
     - 1.0 = prior strongly matches your signal
     - 0.0 = prior strongly contradicts your signal
   - reputation-weight: How much do you care about reputation? [0.0 - 1.0]
