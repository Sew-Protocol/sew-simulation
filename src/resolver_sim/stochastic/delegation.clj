  "Delegation and multi-resolver collusion mechanics (Phase F).
   
   Key concepts:
   - Senior resolver: posts large bond, covers multiple juniors
   - Junior resolver: delegates to senior, uses senior's coverage
   - Waterfall slashing: junior bond → senior coverage → senior bond
   - Coverage multiplier: M=3 (senior bond × 3 = total coverage available)
   - Utilization cap: U=50% (max 50% of coverage can be reserved)")
