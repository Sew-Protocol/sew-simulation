  "Panel voting, correlation, and herding dynamics.
   
   Phase P Lite: Replaces single resolver with n-person panel.
   
   Key insight: Panels create two new failure modes:
   1. Correlated errors: If resolvers share priors (rho > 0), wrong majority wins
   2. Herding: If slashing penalizes deviance, truth-tellers converge on wrong answer
   
   Together, these can invert the dominance ratio even if individual accuracy is fine."
