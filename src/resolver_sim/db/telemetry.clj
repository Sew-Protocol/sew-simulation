(ns resolver-sim.db.telemetry
  "Adapter between the contract-model runner and the eval-engine XTDB store.

   Converts run-trial / run-with-divergence-check output into the generic record
   format expected by resolver-sim.db.store and writes it to XTDB.

   Records are stored in the protocol-agnostic sim_trial_results table.
   Protocol-specific fields are serialised as a metrics_edn blob, populated via
   DisputeProtocol/io-projection with the :telemetry-record target.

   All write functions accept a datasource as their first argument.
   Passing nil is safe: writes become no-ops, enabling offline simulation
   runs and unit tests without a live XTDB instance.

   Typical usage:

     ;; With XTDB running:
     (def ds (evaluation.store/->datasource))
     (telemetry/record-trial! ds protocol batch-id trial-id params result)

     ;; Without XTDB (default, tests):
     (telemetry/record-trial! nil protocol batch-id trial-id params result)"

   Currently emits up to 3 events per trial (SEW lifecycle):
