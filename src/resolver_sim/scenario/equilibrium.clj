(ns resolver-sim.scenario.equilibrium
  "Trace-end mechanism-property and equilibrium-concept validation.

   Activates the :mechanism-properties and :equilibrium-concept fields in CDRS
   v1.1 theory blocks. These fields were previously RESERVED; this namespace
   makes them ACTIVE as terminal trace proxy validations.

   ## What this is

   A lightweight falsification layer that checks whether realised terminal
   outcomes are consistent with claimed economic properties. The output always
   says 'trace-consistent with claimed property', never 'equilibrium proven'.

   A Nash equilibrium requires comparing deviations across many traces.
   A single replay can only check that no observed attack succeeded and no
   invariant was violated. All results carry a :basis field that declares
   the strength of the check (see Claim-Strength Taxonomy below).

   ## Claim-Strength Taxonomy (:basis values)

     :single-trace-terminal-proxy   — terminal world state only; no deviation comparison
     :single-trace-metric-proxy     — accumulated metrics from one trace
     :absent-evidence               — required evidence fields not present → inconclusive
     :not-applicable                — property logically cannot apply in this scenario context
     :multi-trace-required          — only meaningful across N traces; single-trace inconclusive
     :multi-epoch-required          — only meaningful across epochs; single-trace inconclusive

   ## Result statuses

     :pass           — trace is consistent with the claimed property
     :fail           — trace violates the property (hard failure when :severity :hard)
     :inconclusive   — required evidence absent or property requires more than one trace
     :not-applicable — property cannot be evaluated in this scenario context

   ## Severity

     :hard — a :fail blocks the suite (same as expectations failure)
     :soft — a :fail is a warning; :inconclusive is always soft

   ## Protocol extension

     Protocol-specific validators are injected via the DisputeProtocol interface:
       (protocol/mechanism-property-validators protocol)  — returns {kw → fn}
       (protocol/equilibrium-concept-validators protocol) — returns {kw → fn}

     These are merged with the built-in generic validators at evaluation time.
     evaluate-mechanism-properties and evaluate-equilibrium-concepts also accept
     an explicit extra-validators map for direct use outside the protocol dispatch.

   This namespace is pure — no I/O, no DB, no side effects."
