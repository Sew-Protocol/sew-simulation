(ns resolver-sim.scenario.reputation-profiles
  "Named utility profiles for reputation-aware SPE evaluation.

   A profile is a map of utility-spec fields that can be merged into an
   :spe-config :utility-spec.  All profiles extend :resolver-reputation-v1.

   Profile taxonomy (layered):

   Layer 1 — Reputation strength (sensitivity analysis)
     :reputation/none          No reputation effect; tests mechanism without reputation assumptions.
     :reputation/conservative  Low but non-zero penalty; guards against overclaiming.
     :reputation/baseline      Default launch assumption for curated resolver context.

   Layer 2 — Actor type (adversarial / lifecycle realism)
     :actor/senior-resolver    High future value; strong status-loss deterrence.
     :actor/exiting-resolver   Final-period risk; low future earnings expected.

   Layer 3 — Identity continuity (sybil / re-entry resistance)
     :identity/cheap-reentry   Resolver can cheaply abandon identity; weak reputation binding.

   All profiles declare:
     :profile/id               canonical keyword identifier
     :profile/category         :sensitivity | :actor | :market | :adversarial | :governance | :identity
     :profile/evidence-basis   :assumption | :empirical | :stress-test | :placeholder

   Resolved profiles are merged into spe-config.utility-spec before evaluation.
   Fields not present in a profile inherit the caller's utility-spec defaults.")
