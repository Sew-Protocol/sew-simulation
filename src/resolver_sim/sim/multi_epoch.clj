(ns resolver-sim.sim.multi-epoch
  "Multi-epoch reputation simulation (Phase J).
   Runs 10+ epochs with per-resolver tracking to address critical gaps:
   - Gap #1: Sybil resistance (reputation accumulation)
   - Gap #2: Governance failure (detection decay scenarios)
   - Gap #3: Multi-year dynamics (proof of stability)

   Output: Per-resolver history + aggregated statistics + equity trajectories.

   The :equity-trajectories key in the return value is a map
   {resolver-id → [profit@epoch1 profit@epoch2 ...]} built by
   resolver-sim.sim.trajectory/build-equity-trajectories.

   Attribution model: each epoch, batch trials are routed to individual resolvers
   via a TrialRouter (default: :uniform-random). Conservation invariants are
   checked inside run-single-epoch — any routing bug that changes the economics
   throws before it can corrupt trajectory data."
