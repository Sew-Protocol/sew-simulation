  "Phase AD: Governance Bandwidth Floor.

   Safeguard for the Phase AA vulnerability: governance gaming is profitable
   when governance capacity is low and biased toward high-value disputes,
   leaving low-value disputes essentially unreviewed.

   This phase tests whether mandating a minimum review floor — regardless of
   dispute value — reduces attacker win rate below 20% even when overall
   governance capacity is constrained.

   Two levers:
     1. floor-reviews-per-epoch — a hard minimum number of randomly sampled
        low-value disputes reviewed each epoch (the safeguard)
     2. total-capacity          — total reviews available (may be shared)

   Hypothesis to confirm:
     With floor-reviews-per-epoch ≥ 1 per 5 disputes, attacker win rate < 20%
     across all governance bandwidth scenarios."
