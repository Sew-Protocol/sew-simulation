  "Phase AB: Per-Dispute Effort Rewards.

   Safeguard for the Phase Y vulnerability: evidence fog causes resolvers to
   defect when effort cost exceeds fee income.  This phase tests whether
   adding a per-dispute effort-reward multiplier (fee × complexity-tier)
   keeps the defection rate below 20% across evidence complexity tiers.

   Effort tiers (mirrors Phase Y's attention-budget model):
     :low    — simple dispute, 1× base fee
     :medium — moderate complexity, 2× base fee
     :high   — evidence-heavy dispute, 4× base fee

   Resolver defection model:
     Resolver defects when expected-income < effort-cost.
     effort-cost = base-effort-cost × complexity-multiplier
     expected-income = base-fee × reward-multiplier (the safeguard lever)

   Hypothesis to confirm:
     With reward-multiplier ≥ tier-complexity-multiplier, defection rate < 20%
     across all tiers.  Without the multiplier (reward = 1×), high-complexity
     tiers breach the 20% threshold."
