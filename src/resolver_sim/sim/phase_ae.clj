  "Phase AE: Fair Slashing Hypothesis Sweep.

   Tests whether the DR3 fair-slashing corrections (PENDING fraud window,
   24h TIMEOUT_RESOLVE contest window, appeal bond enforcement) preserve
   resolver capital in false-positive slash scenarios.

   Hypothesis:
     With a PENDING fraud window and 24h timeout contest, a resolver
     experiencing a false-positive slash can recover capital in ≥95% of
     scenarios where governance makes the correct appeal decision.

   Parameters swept:
     :appeal-window         — seconds [86400, 259200, 604800] (1d, 3d, 7d)
     :appeal-bond-usd       — USD equivalent [0, 50, 100, 200]
     :p-correct-appeal      — probability governance decides correctly [0.7 0.8 0.9 0.99]
     :timeout-contest-window — seconds [43200, 86400, 172800] (12h, 24h, 48h)

   Pass threshold: ≥80% of resolver capital correctly preserved across
   false-positive scenarios."
