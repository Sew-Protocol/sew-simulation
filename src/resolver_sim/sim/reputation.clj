  "After each epoch, remove exited resolvers, add new ones to maintain population.

   Classifies each exit as either a :slashed-exit (resolver had ≥1 slash event)
   or a :natural-exit (profit-driven / base-rate). This distinction drives two
   behaviour differences for replacements:

   1. Identity cost — replacement resolvers filling slashed-exit slots start with
      a negative initial profit equal to (identity-cost-bps / 10000) * escrow-size.
      This models the on-chain registration stake or cooldown cost that the real
      protocol can impose on re-registering resolvers.

   2. Probationary period — replacements for slashed exits carry
      :probation-until-epoch = (epoch-num + probation-epochs). During this window
      calculate-exit-probability applies :probation-exit-multiplier, making these
      resolvers more likely to exit again (elevated scrutiny).

   New params consumed (all default to 0 / backward-compatible):
     :identity-cost-bps         — registration cost in bps of :escrow-size (default 0)
     :probation-epochs          — epochs of elevated scrutiny after slashed re-entry (default 0)
     :probation-exit-multiplier — exit-prob multiplier during probation (default 1.5)
