(ns resolver-sim.sim.capacity-exhaustion
  "Capacity exhaustion simulation.

   Runs six scenarios that exercise per-resolver maxConcurrentDisputes:

     SIM-01  Single resolver: finite capacity blocks excess disputes
     SIM-02  Capacity freed after resolution (slot reuse)
     SIM-03  Capacity freed after timeout (auto-cancel)
     SIM-04  Multi-resolver: two resolvers, disputes spread across both
     SIM-05  All-resolvers-full: system liveness — every slot exhausted
     SIM-06  Flood sweep: dispute rate vs capacity, measures rejection rate

   Each scenario checks:
     - resolver-capacity-invariant? after every state change
     - correct current-active counter at every checkpoint
     - escrow final states are correct
     - conservation-of-funds invariant throughout"
