  "Phase U: Adaptive Attacker Learning
   
   Tests whether attackers can optimize strategies across epochs.
   
   Key question: Can an attacker learn which strategies work best
   and concentrate attacks on high-ROI methods?
   
   Scenarios:
   1. Static strategy: Same attack method every epoch
   2. Learning attacker: Switches to best-performing strategy
   3. Adaptive defense: System parameters change mid-simulation
   
   Measures:
   - Success rate over time (do attackers improve?)
   - Strategy convergence (do they pick one winning strategy?)
   - Governance lag (can updates outpace learning?)
   - Budget efficiency (cost per successful attack)"
