(ns resolver-sim.sim.phase-z-scenarios
  "Phase Z adversarial scenarios mapped to the contract-model replay format.

   Phase Z (resolver-sim.sim.phase-z) tests legitimacy and reflexive
   participation collapse.  Its five tests identify system-level risks:

     TEST 1 Baseline           → resolver always present           → no liveness risk
     TEST 2 Market Shock       → 40% resolver exit at epoch 30     → resolver absent path
     TEST 3 Scam Wave          → high false-positive slash rate     → honest resolver slashed
     TEST 4 Combined Shocks    → exit + false positives            → cascade + slash
     TEST 5 Cascading Failures → low accuracy + slow resolution    → disputes time out

   This namespace translates those macro-level risks into concrete EVM
   action sequences that stress the contract layer.  Each scenario is a
   valid input to replay-scenario and produces a scored, persistable trace.

   Mapping:
     TEST 2/4 → resolver absent: dispute raised, nobody resolves → auto-cancel after 90 days
     TEST 3   → false positive: resolver cancels a honest-release escrow → buyer wrongly refunded
     TEST 5   → liveness cascade: two escrows dispute; resolver resolves none; both auto-cancel

   Persistence:
     (persist-top-n! n) runs all Phase Z scenarios, scores them, persists top-n.
     (persist-top-percent! p) keeps the top p fraction (0.01 = 1%)."
