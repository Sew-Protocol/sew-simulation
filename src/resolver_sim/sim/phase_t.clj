  "Phase T: Governance Capture via Rule Drift.

   Tests whether an attacker with partial governance control can drive
   safety-critical parameters (slash multiplier, appeal bond) below
   viability thresholds via repeated small incremental votes.

   Three falsifiable hypotheses:

   H1 — Stake threshold:
     An attacker with ≤ 35% governance stake cannot breach safety floors
     in 100 epochs at abstention ≤ 30%, with or without timing optimisation.

   H2 — Timing attack:
     An attacker with 40% stake exploiting low-salience governance periods
     (abstention spike +20pp every 5th epoch) accumulates meaningfully more
     drift than the same stake without timing optimisation.  At 45% stake the
     threat is more acute: breach is expected within 50 epochs.

   H3 — Detect-and-revert safeguard:
     Auto-reverting one drift step whenever a 10-epoch window shows > 0.10
     accumulated drop keeps the 40% + timing scenario safe for 100 epochs.

   Safety floors:
     slash-multiplier ≥ 1.5   (below: fraud becomes profitable)
     appeal-bond-bps  ≥ 200   (below: spam appeals become cheap)

   Attacker strategy:
     Each epoch: propose to reduce slash-multiplier by 0.05 (then appeal-bond
     by 25 bps once the slash floor is threatened).  Changes take effect after
     governance-delay-epochs (default 5) — mimicking on-chain timelock.

   Vote model:
     Attacker controls `attacker-stake` fraction of votes.
     Defenders control `1 - attacker-stake`, but a fraction `abstention` do
     not vote.  The proposal passes when attacker votes > defender votes:
       attacker-stake > (1 - attacker-stake) × (1 - abstention)
     Abstention is drawn per epoch with ±5% noise around the base rate.
     Timing-attack epochs (every 5th) apply an additional +20pp spike."
