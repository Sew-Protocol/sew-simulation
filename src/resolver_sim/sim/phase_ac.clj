  "Phase AC: Trust Floor & Emergency Onboarding.

   Safeguard for the Phase Z vulnerability: legitimacy collapse caused by the
   reflexive participation spiral (experienced resolvers exit → quality drops →
   user confidence drops → fewer disputes → fewer fees → more exits).

   This phase tests whether enforcing a minimum trust floor (≥ min-resolvers
   experienced resolvers must remain active) combined with emergency onboarding
   (new resolvers are fast-tracked when below floor) prevents legitimacy from
   collapsing below the critical threshold of 0.50.

   Model:
     - Trust score: weighted average of resolver experience levels (0–1)
     - Legitimacy: function of trust score and dispute backlog ratio
     - Exit probability: resolver exits when legitimacy × expected-income < threshold
     - Emergency onboarding: when active resolvers < min-resolvers, N new resolvers
       are added each epoch with base trust = onboarding-trust-level

   Hypothesis to confirm:
     With trust floor active, legitimacy never drops below 0.50 across 50 epochs
     even under adverse initial conditions (high-exit-pressure scenario).

   Phase AC Capacity Expansion (run-phase-ac-capacity-expansion):
     Structural constraint confirmed April 2026 — at 100 disputes/epoch with
     pool×capacity=150, pressure=0.667 and the trust floor fails regardless of
     onboarding params (0/36 viable in threshold search).

     Analytical prediction: resolver-capacity × pool-size ≥ 10× disputes/epoch
     makes the trust floor viable (pressure ≤ 0.10 leaves enough headroom).

     This sweep tests that prediction empirically by sweeping (n-resolvers ×
     resolver-capacity) and finding the actual phase-transition multiplier."

  "Phase AC Capacity Expansion: empirically validate the 10× capacity rule,
   then run root-cause diagnostics when the rule is insufficient.

   Two primary sweeps:
     1. Recruit sweep  — fix resolver-capacity=15, grow pool (1.5× → 10.5×)
     2. Upgrade sweep  — fix pool-size=10,          grow capacity (1.5× → 10×)

   If the primary sweeps find no viable configs, three diagnostic variants are
   tested at the highest capacity point (10×) to identify the root cause:
     A. Mature pool      — initial experience 0.8–1.0 instead of 0.3–0.7
     B. High floor       — min-resolvers = 50% of initial pool (early trigger)
     C. Mature + high floor — both changes combined
