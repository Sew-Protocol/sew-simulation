  "Phase W: Dispute Type Clustering - Adversarial Category Targeting
  
  Tests whether attackers can discover weak dispute categories and
  concentrate attacks there to achieve profitable success rates.
  
  Key insight: Real attacks don't fail uniformly - they find weak corners.
  This test simulates attacker learning which of 10 categories are easiest
  to win in, then concentrating volume there."
