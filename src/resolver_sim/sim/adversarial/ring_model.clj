(ns resolver-sim.sim.adversarial.ring-model
  "Per-member ring coordination model.

   Replaces the aggregate-floor ring exit model in phase-ai with a stochastic
   per-member simulation. Each ring member is an individual actor with its own
   detection roll each epoch.

   Improvements over the aggregate model:
     - Variance: small rings exit unevenly (one lucky epoch, one catastrophic)
     - Entry dynamics: new members join when expected profit > expected detection cost
     - Cascade signalling: ≥2 detections in one epoch triggers remaining members
       to halve their activity (lay low), reducing both income and detection risk
     - Individual member histories: traceable per-epoch trajectories

   Enable via :use-ring-model? true in phase-ai params."
