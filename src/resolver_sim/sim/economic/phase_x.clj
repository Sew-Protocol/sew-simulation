  "Phase X: Burst Concurrency Exploit - Overwhelming Sequential Appeals
  
  Tests whether attacker can circumvent sequential defense by triggering
  many disputes simultaneously, all within the slashing window (before
  governance can freeze escalations).
  
  Key insight: Sequential defense works if disputes are spaced out.
  What if attacker bunches 20+ disputes in one block, before governance
  can respond?"
