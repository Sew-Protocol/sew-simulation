(ns resolver-sim.contract-model.invariants
  "Checkable invariant predicates for the SEW contract model.

   These mirror the runtime guards in InvariantGuardInternal.sol and define
   the specification for future Foundry invariant tests and Halmos properties.

   Each predicate takes a world-state map and returns a map:
     {:holds? bool :violations [...]}

   Invariants:
     1. solvency (single-world)      — total-held[t] = sum(live afa[t])  STRICT =
                                       and total-held[t] <= token-balance[t]  (external)
     2. fee-monotonicity (single)    — total-fees[t] never goes negative
     3. state-irreversibility (cross)— terminal states are absorbing (checked via check-transition)
     4. bond-boundedness (single)    — slash amount <= posted bond per workflow (vacuous until bonds added)
     5. no-double-finalize           — each workflow-id finalizes at most once (structural guarantee)"
