(ns resolver-sim.contract-model.runner
  "Contract-model trial runner and divergence detector.

   Provides a full-lifecycle escrow runner that drives state through the
   contract model (lifecycle → resolution → timed-actions) and exposes
   the same profit fields as the idealised dispute.clj model.

   The divergence detector compares idealized outcomes (from dispute/resolve-dispute)
   against contract-model outcomes and emits a :divergence map when they differ.

   Key design:
     - run-trial returns the same keys as dispute/resolve-dispute so it can be
       dropped into run-batch without changing the aggregation code.
     - divergence fields are extra — existing stats ignore them.
     - run-trial is pure: takes an explicit rng-fn for random decisions.
     - Escalation is modelled with Priority-3 authority (no custom-resolver):
       et.dispute-resolver tracks the current-round resolver through escalations."
