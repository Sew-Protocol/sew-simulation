(ns resolver-sim.contract-model.lifecycle
  "Pure Clojure port of BaseEscrow escrow lifecycle operations.

   Covers:
     create-escrow     — createEscrow (fee deduction, snapshot, auto-times)
     release           — release (release strategy consulted via stub)
     sender-cancel     — senderCancel (mutual consent or unilateral)
     recipient-cancel  — recipientCancel (mutual consent or unilateral)
     auto-cancel-disputed-escrow — autoCancelDisputedEscrow (dispute timeout)

   raise-dispute is in state_machine.clj (transition-to-disputed) since it
   delegates entirely to the state transition; the lifecycle wrapper is here.

   All functions return {:ok bool :world world' :error keyword}.
   Arithmetic: uint256 integer division (no rounding)."
