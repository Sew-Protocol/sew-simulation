(ns resolver-sim.contract-model.authority
  "Pure Clojure port of _isAuthorizedDisputeResolver and ModuleSnapshot
   resolver dispatch logic from BaseEscrow.sol.

   Resolution priority (matches Solidity exactly):
     1. If escrowSettings[wf].customResolver != address(0)
           → only that address is authorized (no override possible)
     2. Else if moduleSnapshot[wf].resolutionModule != address(0)
           → query the module via resolution-module-fn stub
     3. Else fallback
           → authorize if caller == et.disputeResolver

   Module stubs:
     resolution-module-fn — (fn [workflow-id caller] → {:authorized? bool})
       Replaces the staticcall to IResolutionModule.isAuthorizedDisputeResolver.
       Pass nil to simulate 'no module configured'.

   DefaultResolutionModule stub (single-resolver):
     (make-default-resolution-module resolver-addr)
     Returns a resolution-module-fn that authorizes only resolver-addr.

   KlerosArbitrableProxy stub (escalating resolver per level):
     (make-kleros-module resolver-by-level)
     resolver-by-level — map of {level → resolver-addr}
     Returns a resolution-module-fn that authorizes based on current level."
