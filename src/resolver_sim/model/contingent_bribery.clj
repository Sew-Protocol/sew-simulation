  "Phase P: Contingent bribery market modeling.
   
   Model: Attacker offers 'Vote X, or we collateralize in escrow'
   
   Reality vs. simulation assumptions:
   - NOT: Bribery costs nothing (0)
   - NOT: Bribery costs everything (∞)
   - YES: Bribery costs 30-50% of attack benefit (realistic escrow margins)
   
   Economic theory:
   - Attacker's expected profit from attack: E[benefit] - P(caught)·benefit
   - Juror's reservation price: Reward + (1-P(success))·escrow + risk premium
   - Equilibrium: Attacker pays just enough to make jurors indifferent
   
   Phases:
   - Phase P: Simple model (contingent escrow only)
   - Phase P+: Could add coordination bonus, repeated games, reputation
   - Phase Q: Compare with evidence spoofing costs

(defn contingent-bribe-cost
  "Calculate attacker's cost to bribe panel into wrong vote.
   
   Phase P core model: Contingent escrow with margin
   
   Reality:
   - Attacker expects to gain attack-benefit from forcing wrong outcome
   - This is the profit if they control the panel outcome
   - Bribery cost is a fraction of this attack benefit
   - Fraction depends on: detection probability + margin (1.3 = 30% of benefit)
   
   Formula:
   cost = attack-benefit × margin × detection-probability
   
   Examples:
   - escrow 10k, benefit 1k, detection 25%, margin 1.3:
     cost = 1k × 0.3 × 0.25 = 75 (very cheap - attacker risk is low)
   - same with detection 50%:
     cost = 1k × 0.3 × 0.50 = 150 (more expensive)
   
   Parameters:
   - escrow-wei: Size of dispute (wei)
   - fee-bps: Resolver fee in basis points (0-1000)
   - attack-benefit-ratio: Fraction of escrow attacker expects to gain (0.05-0.20)
   - detection-prob: Likelihood of being caught (0-1)
   - bribe-cost-ratio: Margin above base cost (1.0-1.5)
