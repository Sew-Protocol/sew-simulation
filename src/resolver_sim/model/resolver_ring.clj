(ns resolver-sim.model.resolver-ring
  "Resolver collusion ring simulation (Phase F).
   
   Models a coordinated group of resolvers:
   - All lie on all disputes (100% collusion rate)
   - Share profit/loss within the ring
   - Waterfall slashing depletes senior coverage
   
   Metrics:
   - Ring profit = sum of profits across all members
   - Catch rate = % of disputes where ring is caught
   - Member states = individual bond remaining per resolver")
