eth_failure_modes_2.py — Ethereum-specific failure mode scenarios S29–S33.

Each scenario models a distinct on-chain attack or failure:

  S29  f6-resolver-cartel             All escalation levels controlled by same entity
  S30  f7-profit-threshold-strike     Resolver refuses unprofitable small disputes
  S31  f8-appeal-fee-amplification    Attacker repeatedly escalates to force re-resolution
  S32  f9-subthreshold-misresolution  Fraudulent L0 resolution corrected at L1
  S33  f10-cascade-escalation-drain   Capacity-limited arbitrator overwhelmed by disputes

Usage:
    python python/eth_failure_modes_2.py

Requires the Clojure gRPC server:
