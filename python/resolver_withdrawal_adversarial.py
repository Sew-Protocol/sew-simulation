"""
High-value adversarial scenario: resolver withdrawal pressure test.

Purpose:
  1) Probe whether a resolver can perform a voluntary stake-withdrawal action
     while holding an active dispute.
  2) Continue through a valid lifecycle to ensure no invariant/liveness break.

Notes:
  - The current action surface has stake registration/slashing but no explicit
    withdraw-stake action. We still probe by attempting a synthetic
    "withdraw_stake" action and assert it is rejected.
  - Requires the Clojure gRPC server on localhost:7070.

Run:
  cd python && python resolver_withdrawal_adversarial.py
