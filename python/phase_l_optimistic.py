Phase L: Optimistic Resolution Scenarios.

Verifies the 'Socialized Security' hypothesis: the protocol remains robust

    S35 — Phase L Watchtower Robustness.
    
    Setup:
      - Resolver 0 (r0) is malicious.
      - Resolver 1 (r1) is honest.
      - Watchtower (wt) is a third-party observer.
      - Buyer (victim) is OFFLINE (never appeals).
      - challenge_window_duration is active (3 days).
      - challenge_bounty_bps is set to 2000 (20% of slashed amount).

    Attack:
      - Malicious r0 misresolves in favor of the seller.
      - Buyer does nothing.
      - Watchtower (wt) challenges the resolution.
    
    Result:
      - Dispute escalates to r1.
      - Honest r1 reverses the decision.
      - r0 is slashed 100%.
      - Watchtower (wt) receives a bounty from the slashed stake.
