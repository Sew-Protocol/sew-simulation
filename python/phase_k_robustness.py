    S34 — Phase K Auto-Slash Robustness.
    
    Setup:
      - Resolver 0 (r0) is malicious.
      - Resolver 1 (r1) is honest (Senior tier).
      - Fraud detection probability is set to 0.
      - Reversal slashing is active and set to 10000 bps (100%).
      - Initial stakes are exactly matching the escrow amount (1:1 ratio).

    Attack:
      - Malicious r0 misresolves in favor of the seller (collusion).
      - Buyer appeals to Level 1.
      - Honest r1 reverses the decision.
    
    Result:
      - Malicious r0 is slashed automatically upon r1's resolution.
      - Slashed amount (100%) covers the full gain of the fraud.
      - Attack is net-negative or net-zero, making it economically non-viable.
