# Interface Contract (Clojure Core + Python Adversarial Bridge)

## Purpose

This document defines the interface boundary between:

1. **Core simulation authority (Clojure)** — canonical replay, state transitions, invariants.
2. **Adversarial bridge (Python)** — optional orchestration layer used when adversarial strategy generation/live stepping is required.

> Python is not the core runtime contract owner. Clojure is authoritative.

---

## Authority Model

- Clojure replay/protocol model is source of truth for execution and invariants.
- gRPC wire format is JSON over unary RPC methods.
- Wire keys are `snake_case`; Clojure internally uses kebab-case keywords.

Reference points:
- `src/resolver_sim/server/grpc.clj` (`snake->kw`, `kw->snake`)
- `src/resolver_sim/contract_model/replay.clj`
- `src/resolver_sim/protocols/protocol.clj`

---

## Key Mapping Contract

### Wire JSON ↔ Clojure internal

| Wire JSON key | Clojure key |
|---|---|
| `session_id` | `:session-id` |
| `initial_block_time` | `:initial-block-time` |
| `protocol_params` | `:protocol-params` |
| `trace_entry` | `:trace-entry` |
| `world_view` | `:world-view` |
| `workflow_id` | `:workflow-id` |
| `is_release` | `:is-release` |

Rule:
- `snake_case -> kebab-case keyword` on parse.
- `kebab-case keyword -> snake_case` on stream.

Keyword values are also normalized to snake_case strings on wire.

---

## Scenario Replay Contract (Core)

Canonical Clojure replay scenario shape (`replay.clj`):
- `:schema-version`
- `:scenario-id`
- `:agents`
- `:protocol-params`
- `:initial-block-time`
- `:events`

Event core fields:
- `:seq`, `:time`, `:agent`, `:action`, `:params`

---

## Alias Semantics (Core)

Generic alias key:
- `:save-id-as` on a successful create event stores created integer ID into replay alias map.

Resolution:
- Protocol `resolve-id-alias` receives each event before dispatch.
- If `:params/:workflow-id` is string alias, protocol resolves to integer ID.
- Unresolved alias returns `:unresolved-alias` and replay outcome is `:invalid`.

### Legacy compatibility note

Historically, some Python fixtures used `save-wf-as` and kebab-case keys.
For Python adversarial bridge compatibility, scenario ingestion may normalize:
- `save-wf-as -> save_id_as`
- kebab-case keys -> snake_case

Core canonical naming remains generic (`save-id-as`).

---

## Python Adversarial Bridge Contract

Python bridge should emit snake_case payloads:
- scenario keys: `schema_version`, `scenario_id`, `initial_block_time`
- event params: `workflow_id`, `is_release`
- withdrawal params: `amount` for `withdraw_stake`

### `withdraw_stake` action contract

- Action: `withdraw_stake`
- Caller: resolver identity (agent address)
- Params: `{ "amount": <positive integer> }`
- Accepted when:
  - caller has sufficient resolver stake, and
  - caller is not currently assigned as dispute resolver for any active `:disputed` escrow.
- Rejected with:
  - `invalid_amount`
  - `insufficient_stake`
  - `active_disputes_block_withdrawal`

When loading legacy adversarial fixtures, Python may normalize accepted aliases/forms before replay via gRPC.

---

## Change Policy

If any interface key/alias behavior changes:

1. Update this document in the same PR.
2. Update compatibility tests (`python/tests/test_interface_contract.py`).
3. Keep integration-only behavior separate from non-integration compatibility tests.

## Scenario Generation Boundary (Canonical Ownership)

This section is normative and exists to prevent semantic drift.

Formal architecture record:
- `docs/architecture/ADR-0003-canonical-scenario-generation-boundary.md`

### Canonical owner: Clojure

The following concerns are **owned by Clojure** and must be implemented in
`src/resolver_sim/*`:

- Scenario generation semantics (`src/resolver_sim/generators/*`)
- Action validity and eligibility against protocol state
- Stateful sequence progression and deterministic replay compatibility
- Adversarial profile semantics used for canonical fixture generation
- Trace-end mechanism/equilibrium evaluation (`scenario/equilibrium.clj`)

Authoritative paths include:
- `src/resolver_sim/generators/actions.clj`
- `src/resolver_sim/generators/stateful.clj`
- `src/resolver_sim/generators/adversarial.clj`
- `src/resolver_sim/generators/scenario.clj`
- `src/resolver_sim/generators/equilibrium.clj`

### Python role: orchestration/bridge only

Python under `python/sew_sim/*` is an adapter layer and must be limited to:

- gRPC session orchestration and integration harnesses
- live/adaptive experiment drivers
- external tooling and reporting wrappers
- wire-format normalization and compatibility glue

Python must **not** become a second canonical source for protocol-stateful
scenario semantics.

### Anti-regression rules

1. **No shadow protocol logic in Python generation paths**
   - If an action validity rule depends on protocol state, it belongs in Clojure.

2. **Clojure-first for new scenario semantics**
   - New action families, timing rules, or adversarial profiles must land in
     `src/resolver_sim/generators/*` first.

3. **Determinism contract**
   - Seeded Clojure generation must remain deterministic (same seed => same events).

4. **Replay compatibility contract**
   - Generated scenario output must remain compatible with
     `resolver-sim.contract-model.replay/replay-scenario`.

5. **Cross-language contract tests when boundary changes**
   - Any boundary change must include updates to docs + tests (Clojure and Python where relevant).

### Review checklist (PR guardrail)

For PRs touching generation or adversarial logic, confirm:

- [ ] Canonical semantics were added/changed in Clojure, not Python
- [ ] Replay/invariant tests still pass for generated scenarios
- [ ] Seed determinism is preserved
- [ ] Interface contract docs updated if behavior changed
