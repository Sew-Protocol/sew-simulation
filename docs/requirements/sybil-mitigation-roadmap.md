# SEW Protocol: Security Requirements for Sybil Ring Mitigation

## Executive Summary
Stochastic simulations (`phase-ai`, `H2`) reveal that the protocol is vulnerable to a "Sybil Escalation Trap." In this attack, a coalition of Sybil resolvers forces honest participants into repeated L2 escalations, draining their capital reserves until they are displaced. Simulations demonstrate that simple detection, mandatory escalation delays, or exponential bond scaling are **insufficient as standalone defenses**. A multi-layered defense is required to maintain protocol liveness and honest market share.

## 1. Vulnerability Profile
- **Failure Mode:** "Collapse" displacement pattern where 100% of honest resolvers are displaced within 200 epochs.
- **Root Cause:** Asymmetric capital requirements. The protocol forces honest actors to post escalating bonds to defend against potentially fraudulent verdicts, while the Sybil coalition exploits the protocol's inability to differentiate between individual and coordinated escalation events.
- **Observation:** Attackers effectively adjust escalation frequency to remain profitable even under mitigation.

## 2. Multi-Layered Security Requirements

To achieve resilience, the protocol implementation must transition from static checks to a dynamic, layered security model:

### Layer A: Structural Escalation Delays
- **Requirement:** Implement a mandatory cooldown period (`escalation-delay-epochs`) between escalations from the same identified resolver cohort.
- **Function:** Prevents same-block escalation spam and increases the time-to-attack for the coalition.

### Layer B: Dynamic Bond Scaling
- **Requirement:** Implement an exponential bond cost increase for repeated escalations (`bond-multiplier`).
- **Function:** Dramatically increases the economic cost of the "trap," turning the attack into an unsustainable capital drain for the coalition.

### Layer C: Correlation-Based Detection
- **Requirement:** Integrate an observer-node mechanism that monitors escalation timing.
- **Function:** Act as a "soft" trigger for governance or protocol-level action (e.g., reducing the voting weight of suspected clusters or flagging them for additional bond scrutiny).

## 3. Implementation Roadmap
1. **Structural Hardening:** Prioritize the implementation of Layers A and B as fundamental protocol-level changes.
2. **Observability:** Integrate Layer C to inform governance and monitoring dashboards.
3. **Continuous Validation:** Use the `sybil-ring-mitigation-*` scenario suite in the CI gate to ensure that these defenses remain effective as protocol parameters evolve.
